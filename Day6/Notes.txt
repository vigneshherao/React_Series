● Why do we need a useEffect Hook?

THis is super variable used in react! This if the variable changes the react component rerenders the component quickly!
However,
because React rerenders the entire component when a state variable
changes, it essentially creates a new instance of ‘ reactBtn ' with the
updated value. So, in essence, we're not updating ‘ reactBtn '; instead, React
creates a new one with the modified value each time the state changes.
This is the beauty of React.
